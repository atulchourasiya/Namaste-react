- Props is something that we can dynamically pass the data to another component 
- Props are just a normal argument to a function
- React will collect all the props and pass it like a object 
- we can also destructure props on the fly
- config driven UI - our website is driven by data  
- suppose we need some card in delhi and some other card in banglore than instead of make different card for each state we can save card color and text everything that is dynamic to the database this is known as config driven UI.
- whenever you are looping need to pass a key
- key will keep track of which element get updated
- React says that never use index as a key
- not using key<<<< index <<<< unique key
