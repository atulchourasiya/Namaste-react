# Lets get hooked

- Anything you can do with react you can do it by normal html css js
- its not a good practice to keep everything in the one file
- we can also build out app without src folder
- we can write .js .jsx .tsx
- Never ever keep hardcoded data in component file
- there are two type of export 1. Default export 2. Named Export
- we can only have one default export in our file
- always try to write code in 100 line per component
- hooks are also a normal  javascript function
-  React element is the plain javascript object
